Every output file generated is placed in the output folder; the outputs generated (while executing "make all")
include a bin folder with all the compiled verilog files. A logs folder where all the log files for each counter
are stored. A gtkwave where all the .vcd files are stored for GtkWave visualization. Moreover when this .vcd
files are opened using this makefile; a data formating script is executed to add the signals with predefined
colors and a PDF file showing the scope is automatically generated for each counter. Finally a .v file is
generated while synthesizing named contador_sint.v

-To generate the complete verification test (with visualization) in the conductual and synthesized component (4 different clock times) use "make" (or "make all").

-To just compile the .v file execute "make iverilog"

-To execute the previously generated compiled files execute "make vvp"

-To see the execution results in gtkwave of the conductual and synthesized component (4 different clock times) use "make gtk"

-To generate and print in console the log files generated execute "make logs" (in case of a previous generation you can execute "make showlogs" to show the previously generated log files)

-To simply generate the synthesized file use "make synth"

-To read this file use "make help"

-To clean every output previously generated execute "make clean"
